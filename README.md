This project will contain JSON and XML schemas for test (and Trial [aka TestClass], TrialSuite [aka TestSuite]) reporting across languages and testing frameworks.  In addition it will have Java auto generated by Jaxb for the XML stuff and Java generated by https://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ and hand written Java that works with Jackson's JSON mappings, and bridges the other autogenerated Java.  Eventually this will be the modeling for a Jenkins plugin to create charts for all of the testing and code coverage from any language.
